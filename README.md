# Do tall people have greater odds of developing cardiovascular disease than short people?


An Analysis of a Kaggle Dataset

CVD, also known as cardiovascular disease, or colloquially known as “heart disease” is a prominent illness that impacts the heart and vascular system throughout the body. It affects many Americans nationally, and is the leading cause of death for Americans annually[1]. 
According to the CDC, one person dies every 34 seconds from heart disease[2]. It is said that up to 80% of CVD can be prevented via changes to modifiable risk factors, of which high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diet, physical activity, and obesity are a part [3]. 

There are many different types of cardiovascular disease, a major one being stroke, which is defined as a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain, and hypertension. Additionally, 1 in 6 deaths from cardiovascular disease was from stroke in 2020[4].
There are many factors that can impact risk, and there is a question of whether an immutable characteristic like height can impact odds of developing cardiovascular disease, in combination with modifiable risk factors such as exercise or BMI. 
According to a study performed by Samara, Elrick, and Storms, “..the results…indicate that shorter people have substantially lower rates of CHD mortality and moderately lower levels of stroke mortality. For example…shorter ethnic groups vs taller groups in California had substantially lower mortality rates”[5].
